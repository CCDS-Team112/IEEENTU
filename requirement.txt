“Contact Doctor” with auto Meet link

Add UI entry point

After showing symptom-check result, display a primary button: “Contact doctor”

Clicking opens an Appointment booking screen

Appointment booking screen (minimal)

Inputs:

User email (required, validate format)

Slot picker: show a short list of preconfigured next 5 available slots

Constraints:

One doctor calendar only (single clinic account calendar)

Fixed duration: 15 minutes

CTA: Confirm appointment

Slot generation (minimal)

Backend provides “next 5 slots” for the clinic calendar (simple implementation OK):

Generate from a configured schedule (e.g., predefined times) OR

Compute next 5 15-min blocks from “now” within configured clinic hours

Ensure chosen slot is still available at booking time (basic conflict check)

Create calendar event (backend)

When user confirms:

Create a calendar event on the clinic calendar with:

Title: “Virtual consultation”

Start/end: selected slot start + start+15m

Attendee: user email

Description: symptom check summary (include AI doctor summary if available)

Google Meet conferencing enabled (auto-generate Meet link)

Return to client:

Meet link

Calendar event id

Persist appointment record

Store an Appointment row/document with:

id

user_email

slot_start_time

slot_end_time

meet_link

calendar_event_id

created_time

status = "confirmed"

Email the user (minimal)

After event creation, send an email to user_email containing:

Meet link

Time slot

Basic instructions (“Click link at time of appointment”)

If email fails but event was created:

Still show Meet link on screen and mark appointment confirmed

Log email failure for retry/manual follow-up (no reschedule logic)

Confirmation screen

Show:

Appointment time

Meet link (clickable + copy button)

“Appointment confirmed” state

Error handling

If slot is no longer available: prompt user to pick another slot (refresh list)

If calendar event creation fails: show “Couldn’t book—try again” + allow fallback to normal flow

If AI is slow/unavailable, booking must still work using rule-based symptom summary

API endpoints (suggested minimal)

GET /appointments/slots → returns next 5 slots (start/end)

POST /appointments body: { userEmail, slotStartTime, symptomSummaryText }

response: { appointmentId, calendarEventId, meetLink, slotStartTime, slotEndTime }

Demo success metric

From symptom result → confirmed Meet link displayed in under 1 minute

Optimize for speed: prefetch slots, keep calls minimal, show loading + fast failure messages

Explicitly out of scope

Payments, multiple doctors, reschedule/cancel, chat, insurance
